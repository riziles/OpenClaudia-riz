//! Canonical slash-command catalogues.
//!
//! There are two user-facing chat seams:
//! - the legacy line-oriented REPL, which exposes the broad command
//!   registry in [`SLASH_SECTIONS`]
//! - the default full-screen TUI, which currently implements a smaller
//!   command set in [`TUI_SLASH_SECTIONS`]
//!
//! Keep these catalogues honest for the seam that renders them. The TUI
//! must not import the legacy table and advertise commands that route to
//! `Unknown command` in `App::handle_slash_command`.
//!
//! Entries are grouped by section to preserve the visual structure each
//! seam renders. The legacy CLI printer renders each section as its own
//! heading; the TUI overlay renders the smaller TUI-specific sections.
//!
//! Out of scope for this table:
//! - Keybindings (TUI-only; see `tui/components/help.rs`)
//! - Shell `!cmd`, note `#text`, file `@path` syntax (CLI-only)
//! - `/plugin-name:command` open-ended plugin dispatch (registry bypass)
//!
//! When a new slash command is added to `CommandRegistry`, append it to
//! [`SLASH_SECTIONS`]. When a command is implemented in `tui::app::App`,
//! append it to [`TUI_SLASH_SECTIONS`] with the TUI-specific behavior.

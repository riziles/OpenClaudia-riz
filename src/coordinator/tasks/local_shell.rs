//! `LocalShellTask` — coordinator-visible wrapper over a
//! `BACKGROUND_SHELLS` background shell (crosslink #611).
//!
//! Claude Code routes every background shell through its coordinator
//! so observers (TUI, hooks, `/tasks`) can see which agent owns each
//! shell. `OpenClaudia`'s bash subsystem keeps its own
//! `BACKGROUND_SHELLS` registry (see [`crate::tools::BACKGROUND_SHELLS`])
//! for runtime accounting; this module layers a coordinator view on
//! top:
//!
//! - records the **owning agent** (so we can filter shells per
//!   teammate via [`tasks_for_agent`]),
//! - mirrors the **running/finished** state without taking a lock on
//!   the shell manager,
//! - is `Serialize`/`Deserialize` so the coordinator registry can be
//!   snapshotted.
//!
//! Note the inversion of responsibility: `BackgroundShellManager`
//! owns the OS process; `LocalShellTask` owns the *coordinator*
//! metadata. The two are joined by the shell id string.

//! Startup migration framework for on-disk format changes.
//!
//! Port of Claude Code's `migrations/` directory. Each migration is a
//! small, self-contained unit that checks whether it applies, and if
//! so, upgrades one on-disk artifact (settings file, transcript, memory
//! DB, etc.). Migrations run in registration order at startup.
//!
//! # Kinds
//!
//! - **Idempotent** migrations inspect current state each run and
//!   short-circuit when there's nothing to do. Preferred, because they
//!   survive disk rollbacks and partial applies without a separate
//!   completion ledger.
//! - **Once-only** migrations are marked done after their first
//!   successful run via [`CompletionLedger`]. Use only when the
//!   migration can't introspect the target state to detect whether it
//!   already ran (e.g. a one-time notification, an analytics event).
//!
//! # Failure model
//!
//! A migration failure must never crash startup. The runner logs the
//! error and continues with the remaining migrations. Callers get the
//! full per-migration result via [`run_all`]'s return value if they
//! want to surface it.

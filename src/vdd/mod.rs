//! Verification-Driven Development (VDD) Engine
//!
//! Implements the adversarial loop methodology where a Builder AI's output is reviewed
//! by a separate Adversary AI on a different provider with fresh context. The loop
//! continues until the adversary reaches the confabulation threshold (producing mostly
//! false positives), indicating exhaustion of genuine findings.
//!
//! Two modes:
//! - Advisory: Single adversary pass, findings injected into next turn context
//! - Blocking: Full adversarial loop until convergence, response held until clean
//!
//! Based on the VDD methodology: <https://github.com/dollspace-gay/Tesseract-Vault>
//!
//! ## Internal layout
//!
//! - [`engine`] — orchestration state machine (`VddEngine`, advisory + blocking loops)
//! - [`transport`] — HTTP plumbing to adversary + builder providers
//! - [`prompts`] — system prompts and request-template builders
//! - [`triage`] — three-layer finding triage (duplicate, pattern, AI verification)
//! - [`sink`] — chainlink issue creation + on-disk session persistence
//! - [`helpers`] — small utilities (truncation, task extraction, advisory formatting)
//! - [`error`] — `VddError` and result enums
//! - [`finding`], [`review`], [`parsing`], [`static_analysis`], [`confabulation`] —
//!   domain types and pre-existing parsing/analysis support

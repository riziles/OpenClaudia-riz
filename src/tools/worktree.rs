//! Git worktree isolation for agent operations.
//!
//! Provides tools to create and manage isolated git worktrees so agents can
//! work on branches without affecting the main working tree.
//!
//! # Phase 1: no CWD mutation (crosslink #345)
//!
//! Earlier revisions called [`std::env::set_current_dir`] inside the enter
//! and exit handlers. That is process-wide global state: any other thread
//! (proxy, TUI, concurrent tool executor) doing a relative-path operation
//! races against the mutation and sees an inconsistent view of the working
//! directory. POSIX, Rust, and Go all document `chdir` as fundamentally
//! unsafe for concurrent processes.
//!
//! In Phase 1 of the fix:
//!
//! * `execute_enter_worktree` never mutates the process CWD. It creates the
//!   git worktree and returns the new path in its success message. The
//!   caller (REPL / session layer) is responsible for tracking the active
//!   worktree on the session.
//! * `execute_exit_worktree` no longer reads CWD to discover which worktree
//!   to clean up. It requires an explicit `path` argument naming the
//!   worktree to remove.
//! * All `git` invocations take an explicit `cwd` and pass it to
//!   `Command::current_dir`, so no `git` subprocess depends on the parent's
//!   CWD either.
//!
//! Phase 2 (passing the active worktree through `ToolContext` to bash /
//! file / lsp tool calls) is tracked separately — see the follow-up issue
//! filed against #345.

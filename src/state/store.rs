//! [`StateStore`] — the clone-cheap handle every caller takes.
//!
//! Wraps `SessionState` in `Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<…>>` plus a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel so subscribers get notified of
//! each category-level change. Mutations go through
//! [`StateWriteGuard`], which emits an event on drop so it's
//! impossible to forget the notification.
//!
//! ### Why `tokio::sync::RwLock` and not `std::sync::RwLock`
//!
//! Earlier revisions used `std::sync::RwLock` with documentation
//! warning callers never to hold the guard across `.await`. That
//! contract is unenforceable at compile time — a single mishandled
//! `.await` while holding the guard deadlocks the tokio runtime
//! (the worker thread parks waiting for itself) and there is no
//! warning. Switching to `tokio::sync::RwLock` makes guard
//! acquisition an `.await` point (`read().await`, `write().await`)
//! that yields cooperatively on contention. Guards may now be held
//! across other `.await`s without deadlocking the runtime — only
//! suspending the caller until the lock is free.
//!
//! Note that `tokio::sync::RwLock` is *not* poison-on-panic. A panic
//! mid-mutation releases the lock cleanly. The `Drop` impl on
//! [`StateWriteGuard`] still fires on unwind, so the event stream
//! stays coherent.
//!
//! Acquiring the write guard remains a fallible *async* operation
//! only in the sense that it `.await`s — once awaited it cannot
//! fail, so the public API returns the guard directly rather than
//! `Result`.

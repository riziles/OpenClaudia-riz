//! [`StateStore`] — the clone-cheap handle every caller takes.
//!
//! Wraps `SessionState` in `Arc<RwLock<…>>` plus a
//! `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel so subscribers get notified of
//! each category-level change. Mutations go through
//! [`StateWriteGuard`], which emits an event on drop so it's
//! impossible to forget the notification.
//!
//! Locking rules — follow these or deadlock:
//!
//! 1. Never hold a read guard across an `.await`.
//! 2. Never hold a write guard across an `.await`.
//! 3. If you need multiple independent fields, clone them out and
//!    drop the guard before doing work.
//!
//! The write-guard-on-drop pattern means a panic during mutation
//! still emits the event (`Drop` runs on unwind). Subscribers that
//! care about atomicity should snapshot inside the handler.
